--- IMPORTANT ---

Before doing modifications to template files please create backups of the templates.



----- To enable AJAX mode please open

app\design\frontend\YourThemePackage\YourTheme\template\catalog\product\list.phtml file

and add

<div class="amshopby-page-container">

at the top of the file

and 

<div style="display:none" class="amshopby-overlay"><img src="<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/amshopby-overlay.gif')?>" width="32" height="32"/></div>
</div>

at the bottom.

If there is no file catalog\product\list.phtml in your theme, please use the one from \default\default\ and \base\default


You may also enable template hints to check the file location (as some other extensions may change it).

After you've modified the file please go to admin panel -> System -> Configuration -> Improved Navigation and set 'Enable AJAX' option to 'Yes'.



----- If you would like to add the layered navigation to the homepage, please do the following: 

1) Open your home page in admin area (CMS > Pages)
2) switch to the "Design" tab
3) set layout "2 columns with left sidebar"
4) paste these lines:
        <reference name="left">
                      <block type="catalog/layer_view" name="amshopby.navleft" after="currency" template="catalog/layer/view.phtml"/> 
        </reference>
into Layout Update XML

Please be aware that some or all of the existing Layout Update XML may be surrounded by the comment tags '<!--' and '-->'. If so, be sure that you paste the above lines outside of the comment pair.

5) save the page
6) set "is anchor" to "yes" for root category

7) If you want to show horizontal navigation at the home page, add cms block to the content area
 {{block type="amshopby/catalog_layer_view_top" name="amshopby.navtop" template="amshopby/view_top.phtml" }}

8) if you want to use AJAX at the page, wrap the products area as below:

<div class="amshopby-page-container">
....
any content here
.....
<div style="display:none" class="amshopby-overlay"><img src="{{skin url='images/amshopby-overlay.gif''}}" width="32" height="32"/></div>
</div>

ADVANCED (not necessary in most cases):
9) If you use custom JavaScripts which modify product list page, and the scripts need initialization,
please add initialization to the skin\frontend\default\default\js\amshopby-ajax.js file, in function amshopby_external

10) If AJAX does not work for sorting and pager it means the div has a CSS selector that differs from "div.toolbar" 
please set this class in the file skin\frontend\default\default\js\amshopby-ajax.js file
